# My_Social_Fox_Internship
During my internship at Social Fox, I was assigned three exciting and diverse tasks to work on:

Task 1: Email Spam Detection Using Machine Learning

For this project, I was tasked with developing a machine learning model for Email Spam Detection. The main objective was to create a robust and accurate classification system capable of distinguishing between spam and non-spam (ham) messages. Utilizing a combination of machine learning techniques and natural language processing (NLP) methods, I aimed to build a reliable solution to combat the persistent issue of email spam.

Task 2: Unemployment Analysis With Python

In this assignment, I conducted an exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python, focusing on unemployment analysis. The primary goal was to gain insights into unemployment trends over time, visualize relevant data, and identify factors influencing unemployment rates. By leveraging Python's data analysis capabilities, I aimed to provide valuable insights into the job market and its dynamics.

Task 3: Car Price Prediction With Machine Learning

The third task revolved around building a machine learning model for predicting car prices. By considering various features and attributes such as make, model, year, mileage, and other specifications, the objective was to develop an accurate regression model. This model would enable estimating car prices effectively, helping potential buyers and sellers make informed decisions in the automotive market.

Throughout the internship, these tasks allowed me to hone my skills in machine learning, natural language processing, data analysis, and Python programming. I was excited to work on these projects and contribute to the development of innovative solutions in different domains.
